Hey buddy.

I have included a sample post inside the /daily/posts folder so you can see the formatting. Remember to save the files as with the extension .md

To upload a new post, the simplest way is to go to the /daily/posts folder on github and 'upload file', drag the file into the browser, click commit changes.

Any questions let me know. Happy blogging.
